                        <h1>Setup For Drawing a Point On Screen</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Now that have a view that allows us to draw to the
                          screen, let's start drawing something.  We'll start
                          by drawing one vertex to the screen.  That may sound
                          boring, but drawing requires covering several concepts
                          at once:  shaders, shader programs (what artists are
                          usually referring to when they talk about "shaders"),
                          buffers (for data, attributes, etc.), and draw commands
                          (we'll just cover one in this post).  All of these
                          concepts together are the foundations of a rendering
                          engine:  another concept that is thrown around, but has
                          a rather ambiguous meaning.  I've seen it used in
                          regard to everything from full applications for making
                          games, to bare bones API's.  If you search for the
                          definition of "rendering engine" on Google, you'll see
                          a definition from PC Mag stating that a rendering
                          engine is, essentially, "software that forms the text
                          and images for display and printing".  What we will be
                          writing here fits that definition quite well.</p>
                        <h2>Setting Up the Project</h2>
                        <p>This step is entirely optional, but it allows you to
                          keep the steps of your code all in one project.  Xcode
                          offers a "Snapshot" feature which you are welcome to
                          use as well, but this rewrites the files in your
                          current project to reflect the changes.  Instead, we're
                          going to use Schemes and Targets.  Essentially this
                          makes a new app within your project.  This means all of
                          your code is accessible right when you need it, and
                          running a particular target (app) is as easy as
                          selecting the appropriate scheme.</p>
                        <p>Before we set up a new scheme, let's work on the one
                          we have.  Every time you make a new scheme, you'll make
                          a new target, info-plist, app, test target, test
                          info-plist, app delegate, view controller, image assets
                          folder, and storyboard.  If you duplicate a target, you
                          reuse the app delegate, view controller, image assets,
                          and storyboard.  In order to tell the difference between
                          each target, we'll rename the target, info-plist, and
                          product.  Click on SwiftOpenGL at the top of the Project
                          Navigator. Then in the Editor, click on the Target and
                          press Return on the keyboard to change the name to
                          Beginning.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Renaming the target.png" alt="Renaming the Tartget"/>
                        <p>Also, rename the Group folder to Beginning as well.
                          If you don't have a group, select <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>,
                          <code>ViewController.swift</code>, <code>SwiftOpenGLView.swift</code>,
                          <code>images.xcassets</code>, <code>main.storyboard</code>,
                          and Supporting Files.  Then right click on the selection
                          and click on New Group from Selection.  Name this group
                          Beginning.  In the Supporting Files folder, change the
                          name of the <code>Info.plist</code> to <code>Beginning-Info.plist</code>.
                          Once the name is changed, you need to let Xcode know
                          what the plist is called now and where it is located.
                          Before we do that though, let's clean up the project's
                          folder in Finder.  You can go straight to the folder to
                          selecting any of the files in the Project Navigator
                          (we'll select <code>Beginning-Info.plist</code>), and
                          then click on the arrow next to the path name.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Navigating to a Folder.png" alt="Navigating to a Folder"/>
                        <p>This will open up the selected file in a Finder window.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Make new folder.png" alt="Make a New Folder"/>
                        <p>Within the SwiftOpenGL project folder, you'll see
                          <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>, <code>ViewController.swift</code>,
                          <code>SwiftOpenGLView.swift</code>, <code>image.xcassets</code>,
                          and <code>Base.proj</code>.  Select these items, right
                          click on them, and click on New Folder with Selection
                          (6 items).  Name this folder Beginning.  Close the
                          window.  In Xcode, you'll notice that you're folders are
                          now red!  You have to click on each and set the path
                          manually.  This is why we didn't set the <code>Info.plist</code>
                          path earlier--we would have had to do that twice!
                          Click on <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>.  In the
                          Utilities panel, on the File Inspector tab, click on
                          the Folder icon instead of the arrow icon.  This brings
                          up a page down menu.  Navigate to the Beginning folder
                          where the <code>AppDelegate.swift</code> file is located.
                          Select <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>, and click Choose.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/The path icon.png" alt="The Path Icon"/>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Choosing the file path.png" alt="Choosing the File Path"/>
                        <p>Repeat this for <code>ViewController.swift</code>,
                          <code>SwiftOpenGLView.swift</code>, and <code>images.xcassets</code>
                          as well as the group folder Beginning (if you miss this
                          one, look at post 1.2).  For the <code>Info.plist</code>,
                          click on the SwiftOpenGL project at the top of the
                          Project Navigator.  Then click on Build Settings.
                          Search for "<code>info.plist</code>".  Under Packaging
                          you'll see see Info.plist File.  To the right of that is
                          the plist file path.  Double click on the path that's
                          there and change it to <code>Beginning/Beginning-info.plist</code>
                          and press Return on the keyboard.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Setting plist path.png" alt="Setting the Plist Path"/>
                        <p>Now we'll change the name of the scheme.  At the top
                          left of the window, to the right of the Stop button is
                          the Scheme dropdown menu.  Click on it and then click on
                          Manage Schemes... at the bottom.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Manage schemes.png" alt="Manage Schemes"/>
                        <p>Again, you see some of the future targets that we're
                          going to create in the image above.  The Manage Schemes
                          menu lists all of the available schemes.  You'll only
                          have one target.  Click on it and press Return on the
                          keyboard.  Rename the scheme as Beginning.  Click close.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Naming the scheme.png" alt="Naming the Scheme"/>
                        <p>Test your app to make sure it still runs.  If it does,
                          you're set to move on to create the next target.  Again,
                          click on the SwiftOpenGL project in the Project Navigator.
                          In the Editor, at the bottom left of the window, click
                          on the "+".</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/New target.png" alt="New Target"/>
                        <p>You'll see the same menu you saw when you created the
                          project.  Make sure Application under the OS X section
                          is selected.  Then select Cocoa Application and click
                          Next.  On the next window, the only change new thing
                          here, is the Project field.  There's only one option
                          here:  SwiftOpenGL.  Set the Product Name as FirstVertex
                          and all the other fields will be the same.  Click Finish.
                          Delete the FirstVertex Test target and its plist.</p>
                        <p>In the Project Navigator, make a new group of the
                          FirstVertex's <code>AppDelegate.swift</code>,
                          <code>ViewController.swift</code>, <code>images.xcassets</code>,
                          <code>main.storyboard</code>, and <code>Info.plist</code>.
                          You can also make a group called Supporting Files out
                          the <code>Info.plist</code>, if you like.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/FirstVertex Group.png" alt="FirstVertex Group"/>
                        <p>Rename the <code>Info.plist</code> as <code>FirstVertex-Info.plist</code>
                          as you see at the bottom of the image above.  Now open
                          a Finder window to location of these files like we did
                          for the last target.  Create a new folder in the
                          SwiftOpenGL project folder called FirstVertex.  Now
                          you'll have Beginning and FirstVertex in your project
                          folder.  Move all of the FirstVertex files into the
                          FirstVertex folder like you did for the Beginning target
                          files.</p>
                        <p>Back in Xcode, set the paths for each file like we did
                          before (remember to set the path for the
                          <code>FirstVertex-Info.plist</code> through Build Phases).
                          Change the name of the scheme for FirstVertex by
                          clicking Manage Schemes... in the Scheme dropdown.  Test
                          the app by running it.</p>
                        <p>If you're app runs, you're ready to set up the UI just
                          like the last post.  I won't go back through that process,
                          except for one detail.  I want to remind you to select
                          the right target when you create a file for the
                          SwiftOpenGLView.  Make sure you save the file to
                          FirstVertex, select the FirstVertex group, and select
                          the FirstVertex target, and not Beginning.</p>
                        <img id="article_img" src="PageImages/Selecting the right target.png" alt="Selecting the Right Target"/>
                        <p>Now you have two working targets.  Make sure the scheme
                          is set to FirstVertex and <code>SwiftOpenGLView.swift</code>
                          is selected before you jump into writing the first
                          version of the render engine.</p>
